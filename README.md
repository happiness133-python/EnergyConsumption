# Natural Gas Forecast Model

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for our natural gas forecast model! This is the first working version of the model, designed to predict the 15-day natural gas forecast based on weather data from the previous year.

## Model Description

My model leverages historical weather data to make accurate predictions about natural gas consumption for the upcoming 15 days. By analyzing patterns and trends in past weather conditions, I aim to provide valuable insights that can help optimize natural gas usage and improve energy efficiency.

## Features

- **15-Day Forecast**: Provides a natural gas consumption forecast for the next 15 days.
- **Weather Data Analysis**: Utilizes weather data from the previous year to make predictions.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Offers valuable insights to help optimize natural gas usage and improve energy efficiency.

## Installation

To get started with the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/happiness133-python/EnergyConsumption.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd natural-gas-forecast
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the model and generate a 15-day forecast, use the following command:

```bash
python forecast.py
