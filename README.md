# Natural Gas Forecast Model

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for our natural gas forecast model! This is the first working version of the model, designed to predict the 15-day natural gas forecast based on weather data from the previous year.

## Model Description

My model leverages historical weather data to make accurate predictions about natural gas consumption for the upcoming 15 days. By analyzing patterns and trends in past weather conditions, I aim to provide valuable insights that can help optimize natural gas usage and improve energy efficiency.

## Features

- **15-Day Forecast**: Provides a natural gas consumption forecast for the next 15 days.
- **Weather Data Analysis**: Utilizes weather data from the previous year to make predictions.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Offers valuable insights to help optimize natural gas usage and improve energy efficiency.

## Installation

To get started with the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/happiness133-python/EnergyConsumption.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd natural-gas-forecast
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the model and generate a 15-day forecast, use the following command:

```bash
python forecast.py

## Weather Data APIs
To obtain forecasted weather data, you can use the following APIs:

WeatherAPI: Provides real-time, forecasted, and historical weather data in JSON and XML formats. It offers a wide range of weather information, including temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and more.

Open-Meteo: An open-source weather API that offers free access to accurate weather forecasts for any location. It provides high-resolution weather data and does not require an API key for non-commercial use.

Weatherstack: Offers detailed and reliable global weather data, including current conditions, forecasts, and historical data. It is suitable for various applications, from travel planning to agricultural management.

### Future Work
Model Improvements: Continually refining the model for better accuracy.

Additional Features: Incorporating more features like real-time weather data and advanced analytics.

Expanded Forecasting: Extending the forecast period beyond 15 days.
